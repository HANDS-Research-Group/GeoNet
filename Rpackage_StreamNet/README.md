# R package "StreamNet"

Functions in this package enable automatic integration of water quality data and stream flowlines to monitor the stream water quality. It allows the user to analyze stream networks to detect statistically significant changes in stream water quality caused by anthropogenic activities. This package is optimized using RCpp to facilitate the high-throughput monitoring of stream water quality.

## Resources

We provide the up-to-date package and testing data resources on this website.
1. You can find the source code for this package in the "source" folder.
2. You can find the bundled package and the binary packages for both Windows and Linux platform in the current directory.
3. In the "Example" folder, you can find a testing script and some testing environments for each function in the package. Each folder in "Example" represents a root path for a function and contains files for polluters, chemistries and flowlines that just satisfy the minimal file requirement. Make sure that you change the paths in the testing script when trying them on your local machine.
